# Clone Task Assignment Change

**Date:** November 1, 2024
**Commit:** d801981
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

---

## Change Summary

**Modified behavior:** Cloned tasks are now automatically assigned to the user who clicks the clone button, instead of keeping the original task's assignment.

---

## What Changed

### Before:
```javascript
assignedTo: task.assignedTo || null,        // Keep original assignment
person: task.person || null,
personName: task.personName || '',
```

When User A cloned a task assigned to User B, the cloned task would also be assigned to User B.

### After:
```javascript
assignedTo: currentUser.id,                 // Assign to cloning user
assignedToIds: [currentUser.id],            // Array of IDs
person: currentUser.name,                   // User's name
personName: currentUser.name,               // Display name
```

When User A clones a task assigned to User B, the cloned task is now assigned to User A.

---

## Affected Fields

When a task is cloned, these fields now use the current user's data:

| Field | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `assignedTo` | Original task's UID | Current user's UID |
| `assignedToIds` | Not set / Original | [Current user's UID] |
| `person` | Original task's name | Current user's name |
| `personName` | Original task's name | Current user's name |

All other fields are preserved from the original task:
- ✅ Task name (with " (Copy)" suffix)
- ✅ Status
- ✅ Priority
- ✅ Project
- ✅ Dates
- ✅ Description
- ✅ Tags
- ✅ Timeline

---

## Code Changes

**File:** index.html (cloneTask function, Line 10801-10815)

```javascript
const currentUser = getCurrentUser();
const clonedTask = {
    name: task.name + ' (Copy)',
    status: task.status || 'pending',
    priority: task.priority || 'medium',
    // Assign cloned task to the user who clicked clone
    assignedTo: currentUser.id,
    assignedToIds: [currentUser.id],
    person: currentUser.name,
    personName: currentUser.name,
    project: task.project || '',
    projectId: task.projectId || null,
    date: task.date || '',
    startDate: task.startDate || '',
    createdAt: new Date()
};
```

---

## Behavior Example

### Scenario:
1. User A (UID: `user_a_123`) is logged in
2. User A sees a task "Smoke Test" assigned to User B (UID: `user_b_456`)
3. User A clicks the Clone button

### Result:
- ✅ Cloned task created: "Smoke Test (Copy)"
- ✅ Assigned to: User A (UID: `user_a_123`)
- ✅ Original task: Still assigned to User B
- ✅ User A can now see and edit the cloned task

---

## Benefits

✅ **Users own their cloned tasks**
- Users don't need to reassign cloned tasks to themselves
- Cloned tasks are immediately actionable by the cloning user
- Reduces workflow friction

✅ **Clear ownership**
- Each user creates tasks for themselves
- Clear responsibility model
- Avoids accidental assignment to wrong person

✅ **Consistent with creation workflow**
- Same as creating a new task
- Users create tasks they're assigned to
- Matches expected behavior

---

## Related Permission

**Required Permission:** Add (on Tasks page)

To clone a task, user must have:
- ✅ "add" permission on Tasks page
- ✅ Task show permission (to see the task)

No change to permission system - same as before.

## Data Structure

### Original Task in Firebase:
```javascript
{
    id: "original_task_123",
    name: "Smoke Test",
    status: "in_progress",
    assignedTo: "user_b_456",
    assignedToIds: ["user_b_456"],
    personName: "User B",
    // ... other fields
}
```

### Cloned Task in Firebase:
```javascript
{
    id: "cloned_task_789",
    name: "Smoke Test (Copy)",
    status: "in_progress",
    assignedTo: "user_a_123",        // Changed to cloning user
    assignedToIds: ["user_a_123"],   // Changed to cloning user
    personName: "User A",             // Changed to cloning user
    // ... other fields (copied from original)
}
```

## User Experience

### Before This Change:
1. User A clones a task assigned to User B
2. Cloned task appears assigned to User B
3. User A must manually reassign to themselves
4. Extra step in workflow

### After This Change:
1. User A clones a task assigned to User B
2. Cloned task automatically assigned to User A
3. User A can immediately work on cloned task
4. No reassignment needed ✅
