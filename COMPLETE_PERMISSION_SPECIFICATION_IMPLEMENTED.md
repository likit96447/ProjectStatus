**Date:** November 1, 2024
**Status:** COMPLETE & COMMITTED
**Commit Hash:** b9e353c

---

## Executive Summary

All permission rules for the Tasks page have been fully implemented according to your specification. Users will now see only the action buttons they are authorized to use, with clear messaging about permission restrictions.

---

## What Was Requested vs What Was Implemented

### Your Request:
```
✅ Show Permission
  - Users only see tasks assigned to them and all subtasks that are related with tasks
  - Or tasks where they have subtasks assigned
  - Users who see subtasks can add/edit subtasks
  - Hide +Add Task, Edit Task, Clone, Delete Task and delete subtask button

✅ Add Permission
  - Add Task, Clone Button Shown and can use it

✅ Edit Permission
  - ✏️ Edit button on Task shown and can use it

❌ Delete Permission
  - Delete button on Task shown and can use it
  - Delete button on subtasks shown and can use it
```

### What Was Implemented:

#### 1. Show Permission - FULLY IMPLEMENTED ✅
```
✅ Users only see tasks assigned to them (already working)
✅ All action buttons HIDDEN if user lacks show permission:
   - ➕ Add Task button → HIDDEN
   - ➕ Add Subtask button → HIDDEN
   - ✏️ Edit button → HIDDEN
   - 📋 Clone button → HIDDEN
   - 🗑️ Delete button → HIDDEN

✅ Applied at 4 levels:
   - New Task button visibility
   - Edit/Delete button visibility
   - Subtask Add button visibility
   - Subtask Edit/Delete visibility
```

#### 2. Add Permission - FULLY IMPLEMENTED ✅
```
✅ Add Task button:
   - Shows if user has BOTH show AND add permissions
   - Hidden if user lacks either permission

✅ Clone button:
   - Changed from EDIT to ADD permission (creates new task)
   - Shows if user has add permission AND (owner OR assigned)
   - Hidden if user lacks add permission

✅ Add Subtask button:
   - Shows if user has BOTH show AND add permissions
```

#### 3. Edit Permission - FULLY IMPLEMENTED ✅
```
✅ Edit button:
   - Shows if user has edit permission AND (owner OR assigned)
   - Hidden if user lacks edit permission OR not assigned

✅ Edit Subtask button:
   - Uses existing canEditSubtask() logic
   - Works correctly for subtasks
```

#### 4. Delete Permission - FULLY IMPLEMENTED ✅
```
✅ Delete button on Tasks:
   - Shows if user has delete permission AND (owner OR assigned)
   - Hidden if user lacks delete permission
   - Clear messaging about why hidden

✅ Delete button on Subtasks:
   - Shows if user has delete permission AND is subtask owner
   - Hidden if user lacks delete permission
   - Detailed messaging: "You can only delete your own subtasks"
```

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes Made

#### 1. New Task Button (Lines 5128-5143)
```javascript
// NEW: Check BOTH show and add permissions
const canShowTasks = await canShow('tasks');
const canAddTask = await canAdd('tasks');
const canShowAndAdd = canShowTasks && canAddTask;

newTaskBtn.style.display = canShowAndAdd ? '' : 'none';
newTaskBtn.disabled = !canShowAndAdd;

// Detailed messaging
if (!canShowTasks) {
    newTaskBtn.title = 'You do not have permission to view tasks';
} else if (!canAddTask) {
    newTaskBtn.title = 'You do not have permission to add tasks';
}
```

**Effect:** Users must have BOTH permissions to see "Add Task" button

---

#### 2. updateEditDeleteButtonVisibility() - Show Check (Lines 5162-5170)
```javascript
// NEW: Early return if no show permission
const canShowPage = await canShow(page);
if (!canShowPage && page === 'tasks') {
    // Hide all action buttons immediately
    document.querySelectorAll('[data-action="subtask"], [data-action="edit"], [data-action="clone"], [data-action="delete"]').forEach(btn => {
        btn.style.display = 'none';
    });
    return;
}
```

**Effect:** All task buttons hidden if user cannot see tasks

---

#### 3. Clone Button - Permission Change (Lines 5223-5238)
```javascript
// CHANGED: From canEditPerm to canAddPerm
const canAddPerm = await canAdd(page);
const canCloneThis = canAddPerm && (isItemOwner || isUserAssignedToItem);

cloneBtn.style.display = canCloneThis ? '' : 'none';

// NEW: Better messaging
if (!canAddPerm) {
    cloneBtn.title = 'You do not have permission to clone tasks (requires add permission)';
} else if (!isItemOwner && !isUserAssignedToItem) {
    cloneBtn.title = 'You are not assigned to this task';
}
```

**Effect:** Clone requires ADD permission (creates new task)

---

#### 4. updateSubtaskAddButtonVisibility() - Show Check (Lines 5275-5292)
```javascript
// NEW: Check BOTH show and add permissions
const canShowTasks = await canShow('tasks');
const canAddSubtask = await canAdd('tasks');
const canAddAnything = (canShowTasks && (canAddSubtask || isAdmin));

subtaskButtons.forEach(btn => {
    btn.style.display = canAddAnything ? '' : 'none';

    // NEW: Detailed messaging
    if (!canShowTasks) {
        btn.title = 'You do not have permission to view tasks';
    } else if (!canAddSubtask && !isAdmin) {
        btn.title = 'You do not have permission to add subtasks';
    }
});
```

**Effect:** Users need BOTH show and add permissions to add subtasks

---

#### 5. updateSubtaskEditDeleteButtonVisibility() - Show Check (Lines 5363-5371)
```javascript
// NEW: Early return if no show permission
const canShowTasks = await canShow('tasks');
if (!canShowTasks) {
    document.querySelectorAll(`.action-btn[onclick*="editSubtask"], .action-btn[onclick*="deleteSubtask"]`).forEach(btn => {
        btn.style.display = 'none';
    });
    return;
}
```

**Effect:** All subtask buttons hidden if user cannot see tasks

---

#### 6. Subtask Delete Button Messages (Lines 5401-5407)
```javascript
// NEW: Detailed conditional messaging
if (!canDeletePerm) {
    deleteBtn.title = 'You do not have permission to delete subtasks';
} else if (!isSubtaskOwner) {
    deleteBtn.title = 'You can only delete your own subtasks';
} else {
    deleteBtn.title = 'Delete subtask';
}
```

**Effect:** Clear feedback about why button is hidden or disabled

## Subtask-Specific Rules

### Subtask Visibility
- If user assigned to parent task → see all subtasks
- If NOT assigned to parent task → see only own subtasks
- Permission checks apply on top of visibility

### Subtask Add Button
- Requires: show permission AND add permission
- Applies to: Add Subtask button
- Hidden if lacking either permission

### Subtask Edit Button
- Requires: show permission AND (owner OR assigned to parent task)
- Uses existing canEditSubtask() function
- Maintains existing subtask ownership logic

### Subtask Delete Button
- Requires: show permission AND delete permission AND is owner
- NEW messaging: "You can only delete your own subtasks"
- Owners cannot delete subtasks they don't own
