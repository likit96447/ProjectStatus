# Edit and Delete Permission Control - Complete Implementation

## Overview

Edit and Delete buttons now properly respect user permissions. Users without the required `edit` or `delete` permission, or who don't own the item, cannot modify or delete it.

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Permission Check Functions

#### `canEditItem(item, page)` - Check Edit Permission
```javascript
async function canEditItem(item, page = 'tasks') {
    if (!item) return false;
    const hasEditPermission = await canEdit(page);
    // Must have permission AND be owner
    return hasEditPermission && isOwner(item);
}
```

**Requirements:**
- User must have `edit: true` permission for the page
- User must own the item (created it or assigned to it)
- Admin users own everything

#### `canDeleteItem(item, page)` - Check Delete Permission
```javascript
async function canDeleteItem(item, page = 'tasks') {
    if (!item) return false;
    const hasDeletePermission = await canDelete(page);
    // Must have permission AND be owner
    return hasDeletePermission && isOwner(item);
}
```

**Requirements:**
- User must have `delete: true` permission for the page
- User must own the item
- Admin users own everything

#### `checkEditPermission(item, page)` - Helper with Error Message
```javascript
async function checkEditPermission(item, page) {
    const canEdit = await canEditItem(item, page);
    if (!canEdit) {
        alert('You do not have permission to edit this item');
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

#### `checkDeletePermission(item, page)` - Helper with Error Message
```javascript
async function checkDeletePermission(item, page) {
    const canDelete = await canDeleteItem(item, page);
    if (!canDelete) {
        alert('You do not have permission to delete this item');
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

### 2. Protected Functions - Projects

#### `editProject(index)` - UPDATED [Line 11368]
```javascript
async function editProject(index) {
    editingProjectIndex = index;
    const project = projects[index];

    // Check permission before opening modal
    if (!await checkEditPermission(project, 'projectslist')) {
        editingProjectIndex = -1;
        return;
    }

    // ... rest of function
}
```

#### `deleteProject(index)` - UPDATED [Line 11448]
```javascript
async function deleteProject(index) {
    const project = projects[index];

    // Check permission before allowing deletion
    if (!await checkDeletePermission(project, 'projectslist')) {
        return;
    }

    // ... rest of function
}
```

---

### 3. Protected Functions - Tasks

#### `editTask(index)` - UPDATED [Line 9915]
```javascript
async function editTask(index) {
    editingIndex = index;
    const task = tasks[index];

    // Check permission before opening modal
    if (!await checkEditPermission(task, 'tasks')) {
        editingIndex = -1;
        return;
    }

    // ... rest of function
}
```

#### `deleteTask(index)` - UPDATED [Line 9873]
```javascript
async function deleteTask(index) {
    const task = tasks[index];

    // Check permission before allowing deletion
    if (!await checkDeletePermission(task, 'tasks')) {
        return;
    }

    // ... rest of function
}
```

---

### 4. Protected Functions - Subtasks

#### `editSubtask(subtaskId)` - UPDATED [Line 9645]
```javascript
async function editSubtask(subtaskId) {
    const subtaskIndex = subtasks.findIndex(st => st.id === subtaskId);
    if (subtaskIndex === -1) return;

    const subtask = subtasks[subtaskIndex];

    // Check permission before opening modal
    if (!await checkEditPermission(subtask, 'tasks')) {
        return;
    }

    // ... rest of function
}
```

#### `deleteSubtask(subtaskId)` - UPDATED [Line 9687]
```javascript
async function deleteSubtask(subtaskId) {
    // Get subtask for permission check
    const subtask = subtasks.find(st => st.id === subtaskId);
    if (!subtask) return;

    // Check permission before allowing deletion
    if (!await checkDeletePermission(subtask, 'tasks')) {
        return;
    }

    // ... rest of function
}
```

## Permission Rules

### Edit Permission
User can edit an item if:
1. ✅ Has `edit: true` permission for the page
2. ✅ AND owns/is assigned to the item (created it or assigned to)
3. ✅ Admins always can edit

**Formula:** `canEdit(page) AND isOwner(item)`

### Delete Permission
User can delete an item if:
1. ✅ Has `delete: true` permission for the page
2. ✅ AND owns/is assigned to the item
3. ✅ Admins always can delete

**Formula:** `canDelete(page) AND isOwner(item)`

## User Experience

Developer can click Edit and modify Task A
Developer cannot see Delete button 🗑️
Developer cannot delete Task A

Developer views Task B (created by someone else)
  ↓
Developer cannot see Edit button (doesn't own it)
Developer cannot see Delete button (doesn't own it)
Developer cannot modify or delete Task B
```

### Scenario 2: Project Manager with Full Permissions

**Permissions:**
```
projectslist:
  edit: true
  delete: true
```

**Experience:**
```

  ↓
Can edit Project A ✏️
Can delete Project A 🗑️

Project Manager views Project B (created by developer)
  ↓
Cannot see edit/delete buttons (doesn't own it)
Cannot modify or delete Project B
```

### Scenario 3: Admin with All Permissions

**Role:** Admin (always owns everything)

**Experience:**
```
Admin can edit ALL projects ✏️
Admin can delete ALL projects 🗑️
Admin can edit ALL tasks ✏️
Admin can delete ALL tasks 🗑️
Admin can edit ALL subtasks ✏️
Admin can delete ALL subtasks 🗑️
```

- Can save changes

**Result:** ✅ Edit works

### Test 3: Delete Permission Denied

## Permission Matrix

### Edit/Delete Availability by Role

| Role | Edit Projects | Delete Projects | Edit Tasks | Delete Tasks |
|------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|------------|
| Admin | ✅ All | ✅ All | ✅ All | ✅ All |
| Project Manager | ✅ Owned | ✅ Owned | ✅ Owned | ✅ Owned |
| Business Analyst | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Owned | ✅ Owned |
| System Analyst | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Owned | ✅ Owned |
| Developer | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Owned | ❌ No |
| QA Lead | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Owned | ❌ No |

**Legend:** ✅ = Allowed, ❌ = Denied, "Owned" = Only for items user created/owns

---

## Security Implementation

### Client-Side (Current)
✅ Buttons hidden/disabled
✅ Modal protection prevents direct access
✅ Error messages shown
⚠️ Not cryptographic - determined user can bypass

### Server-Side (Recommended)
Validate all operations on server:
```javascript
// Before saving edit
if (!await checkEditPermission(item, page)) {
    throw new Error('Unauthorized');
}

// Before deleting
if (!await checkDeletePermission(item, page)) {
    throw new Error('Unauthorized');
}
```

---

## Implementation Details

### How Permission Check Works

```
User clicks Edit button
    ↓
editTask(index) called
    ↓
checkEditPermission(task, 'tasks') called
    ↓
canEditItem(task, 'tasks') checked
    ↓
Has edit=true permission? YES/NO
Is owner of task? YES/NO
    ↓
Both true? Show modal : Show error
```

### Ownership Check Logic

User owns item if:
- Item.createdBy === user.email ✅
- Item.createdByName === user.name ✅
- Item.assignedTo === user.email ✅
- User.role === 'Admin' ✅
