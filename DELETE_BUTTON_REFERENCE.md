# Delete Button Visibility - Quick Reference

## The Issue You Reported
> "User has delete permission but delete button doesn't show"

## The Root Cause
Delete button visibility logic only checked if user was task **owner**, not if user was **assigned** to task.

## The Fix
Updated the visibility check to show delete button if user is:
- ✅ Task owner (created the task), OR
- ✅ Assigned to the task (in "Assigned To" field)

Both require: `delete: true` permission on Tasks page

---

## Before vs After

### Before Fix
```javascript
const canDeleteThis = canDeletePerm && isItemOwner;
// Only task creator could delete
```

### After Fix
```javascript
const canDeleteThis = canDeletePerm && (isItemOwner || isUserAssignedToItem);
// Both task creator AND assigned users can delete
```

## When Delete Button Shows Now

| User Type | Has Delete Perm | Is Owner | Is Assigned | Delete Button |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Manager | ✅ | ✅ | — | ✅ Shows |
| Manager | ✅ | — | ✅ | ✅ Shows |
| Developer | ✅ | — | ✅ | ✅ Shows |
| Developer | ❌ | ✅ | — | ❌ Hides |
| Viewer | ❌ | — | — | ❌ Hides |

## Console Logs to Look For

### Permission Status
```
📋 Edit permission: true, Delete permission: true
```

### Why Button Shows/Hides
```
✅ Task "X" - Delete button: visible (task owner)
✅ Task "X" - Delete button: visible (assigned to task)
❌ Task "X" - Delete button: hidden (no delete permission)
❌ Task "X" - Delete button: hidden (not owner/assigned)
```

---

## Three Most Common Reasons Button Doesn't Show

### Reason #1: User Not Assigned to Task
**Console shows:**
```
❌ Task "X" - Delete button: hidden (not owner/assigned)
```

**Fix (30 seconds):**
1. Click Edit ✏️ on task
2. Find "Assigned To" field
3. Add yourself
4. Click Save
5. Refresh (Ctrl+R)

---

### Reason #2: User Lacks Delete Permission
**Console shows:**
```
📋 Delete permission: false
❌ Task "X" - Delete button: hidden (no delete permission)
```

**Fix:**
- Contact admin
- Ask for delete permission on Tasks page
- Admin checks: Firebase → page_permissions → your role → tasks → delete: true

---

### Reason #3: Browser Cache
**Symptoms:**
- Permission was just enabled
- Console shows: `Delete permission: false`
- But you see permission in Firebase

**Fix:**
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
- Wait 30 seconds (Firebase sync delay)

---

## Step-by-Step Diagnostic

```
1. Open Console (F12 → Console)

2. Search for: "Delete permission:"

   If false:
   └─ Ask admin to enable delete permission

   If true:
   └─ Continue to step 3

3. Look at task "Assigned To" field

   If not you:
   └─ Edit task and add yourself

   If you:
   └─ Continue to step 4

4. Look for warning: "⚠️ Delete button not found"

   If found:
   └─ Button rendering issue (contact admin)

   If not found:
   └─ Refresh page (Ctrl+R) - button should show now ✅
```

---

## For Admins to Verify

**Check Firebase:**
```
Collection: page_permissions
Document: global
Data: YourRole.tasks.delete = true
```

**Have user share:**
```
F12 → Console → Copy lines with:
- "Delete permission:"
- "Delete button:"
```

**Common admin issues:**
- Role name spelling wrong (Manager vs manager)
- Permissions not saved properly
- Firebase sync delay (wait 30s)

❌ Task "Bug Fix" - Delete button: hidden (no delete permission)
✅ Edit/delete button visibility updated for tasks
```

**When not assigned:**
```
🔘 Updating edit/delete button visibility for tasks...
   📋 Edit permission: true, Delete permission: true
❌ Task "Bug Fix" - Delete button: hidden (not owner/assigned)
✅ Edit/delete button visibility updated for tasks

## Related Permissions

These 4 things all use similar logic:

| Feature | Needs | Shows/Hides |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Edit Button | edit: true | If owner OR assigned |
| Delete Button | delete: true | If owner OR assigned |
| Edit Modal | edit: true | If owner OR assigned |
| Delete Execute | delete: true | If owner OR assigned AND other conditions |

---

## Delete Restrictions

Even if delete button shows, actual deletion blocked if:

1. ❌ Task has subtasks
   - Alert: "Cannot delete task because it has X subtask(s)"
   - Must delete subtasks first

2. ❌ User without delete permission clicks button
   - Alert: "You do not have permission to delete tasks"

3. ❌ User tries to delete subtask they can't see
   - Alert: "You can only delete subtasks you can see"
