# Role Activation Feature - Quick Reference Guide

## What Was Added

Three key improvements to the role management system:

### 1. ‚úÖ Toggle Role Active Status
**Function:** `toggleRoleActive(roleId, checkboxElement)`
**Location:** index.html:4589-4616

Allows admins to click the checkbox in the "Active" column to toggle a role between active/inactive.

```javascript
// Usage: Called automatically when checkbox is clicked
onclick="toggleRoleActive('roleId123', this)"
```

**What it does:**
- Updates Firebase with the new active status
- Reverts checkbox if error occurs
- Refreshes member role dropdown if open
- Adds audit trail (updatedAt, updatedBy)

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Reset Active Checkbox on New Role
**Function:** `openAddRoleModal()`
**Location:** index.html:4435

Added one line to reset checkbox to checked:

```javascript
document.getElementById('roleActiveCheckbox').checked = true;
```

**Benefit:** New roles are active by default (better UX)

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Filter Dropdown to Show Only Active Roles
**Function:** `populateMemberRoleDropdown()`
**Location:** index.html:9860-9934

Modified to filter roles where `active !== false`:

```javascript
if (role.active !== false) {
    // Only add this role to dropdown
    const option = document.createElement('option');
    option.value = doc.id;
    option.textContent = role.name;
    roleSelect.appendChild(option);
}
```

**Impact:** Team member role dropdown only shows active roles

## How to Use

### For Administrators

#### To Deactivate a Role
1. Go to Settings ‚öôÔ∏è ‚Üí Role Management
2. Find the role you want to deactivate
3. Click the checkbox in the "Active" column to uncheck it
4. The role is immediately deactivated

#### To Reactivate a Role
1. Find the inactive role (checkbox will be unchecked)
2. Click the checkbox to check it
3. The role is immediately reactivated

#### When Adding Team Members
1. Go to Team Members page
2. Click "Add Member"
3. In the "Role" dropdown, you'll only see active roles
4. Inactive roles won't appear (can't be assigned)

## Firebase Data Structure

### Before (Old)
```javascript
{
    name: "Project Manager",
    description: "Manages projects",
    createdAt: timestamp,
    updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

### After (New)
```javascript
{
    name: "Project Manager",
    description: "Manages projects",
    active: true,              // ‚Üê NEW FIELD
    createdAt: timestamp,
    createdBy: "admin",        // ‚Üê Was already there
    updatedAt: timestamp,
    updatedBy: "admin"         // ‚Üê Was already there
}
```

**Important:** Roles without the `active` field are treated as `active: true` (backward compatible)

## Testing Quick Checklist

- [ ] Toggle a role inactive ‚Üí checkbox unchecks
- [ ] Open team member modal ‚Üí role doesn't appear in dropdown
- [ ] Toggle role back active ‚Üí checkbox checks
- [ ] Open team member modal ‚Üí role reappears in dropdown

## Console Messages to Expect

```
üìã Loading active roles for member dropdown...
‚úÖ Loaded 4 active roles from Firebase (5 total roles)

üîÑ Toggling role active status to false...
‚úÖ Role active status updated to false
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Dropdown still shows inactive role
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Refresh the page
3. Verify Firebase connection

### Issue: Checkbox reverts when toggled
**Solution:**
- This is intentional error handling
- Check console for error message
- Verify Firebase has write permissions

### Issue: New role dialog doesn't have checkbox checked
**Solution:**
- The role should load as active by default
- If not, check browser cache
- Try Ctrl+Shift+Delete to clear cache
