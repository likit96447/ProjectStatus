---

## Summary of Changes

✅ **Add Permission** - Controls new task/clone buttons
✅ **Edit Permission** - Controls edit button
✅ **Delete Permission** - Controls delete button on tasks & subtasks

---

## Changes Made

### 1. New Task Button (Line 5128-5143)
- **Before:** Only checked `canAdd('tasks')`
- **After:** Checks BOTH `canShow('tasks')` AND `canAdd('tasks')`
- **Effect:** Users must have show permission to add tasks

### 2. updateEditDeleteButtonVisibility() (Line 5162-5170)
- **Added:** Early check for show permission
- **Effect:** Hides all task buttons if user has no show permission
- **Code:** Returns early if `canShowPage === false`

### 3. Clone Button Permission (Line 5227)
- **Changed:** From `canEditPerm` to `canAddPerm`
- **Reason:** Clone creates new task, requires ADD permission
- **Effect:** Users without add permission cannot clone

### 4. updateSubtaskAddButtonVisibility() (Line 5275-5292)
- **Before:** Only checked add permission
- **After:** Checks BOTH show AND add permission
- **Effect:** Users must have show permission to add subtasks

### 5. updateSubtaskEditDeleteButtonVisibility() (Line 5363-5371)
- **Added:** Early check for show permission
- **Effect:** Hides all subtask buttons if user has no show permission
- **Code:** Returns early if `canShowTasks === false`

### 6. Subtask Delete Messages (Line 5401-5407)
- **Before:** Simple yes/no message
- **After:** Detailed conditional messages
- **Effect:** Clear feedback on why button is hidden
